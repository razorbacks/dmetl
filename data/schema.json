Through this collaboration I have produced written instruction on how to use SAP retail in the classroom.  I created 8 modules which SAP University Alliance has made available to all Alliance members worldwide.  In addition to writing the curriculum, I was invited by SAP to present the curriculum at their annual professional conference.  I was invited two years in a row.   During the summer of 2009 I also taught SAP retail to other SAP Alliance members during SAP\u2019s summer training program. \n\u2022\tI am currently serving on the Board of Directors for two nonprofit agencies:  Your Media and The Community Preschool.   I am the treasurer for both these organizations.  Your Media is an organization dedicated to the free speech and is currently the service provider for Fayetteville Public Access Television. Community Preschool is a local secular preschool committed to offering high quality low costing preschool education.  In both organizations I am responsible for Payroll, taxes, working with the accountant and all forms of debits and credits. \n\u2022\tThrough Theres Stiefer and the Executive Education I am working with Mary Donohue, Dal Housie University, to bring a Mentoring certification to the United States.

She is well known in the Walton College as one of the best and most creative professors. Molly updates the course every semester with readings selected from her executive advisory board. Her student evaluations are always well above the College and Department means. Molly serves on numerous undergraduate honors theses. In addition, she teaches a doctoral seminar required for all Walton College doctoral students on how to teach a university level course. This doctoral seminar is unique in that most doctoral students do not get formal training on teaching. Given Molly\u2019s expertise, she is the perfect person to facilitate this seminar, often bringing in guest speakers and providing students with the resources they will need for their first course (how to use Blackboard, correct format for syllabi, issues related to evaluation, how to cope with potential problems, etc.). In the last three years, Molly has published two articles in the Journal of Business Research, one in 2012 and one in 2013; this is a well-respected \u201cB\u201d level journal in marketing. She also published a national proceedings article in 2012. Molly has two articles nearly ready for submission, one for the Journal of Business Research and one for the Journal of the Academy of Management Science. Her research agenda generally can be described as contributing to knowledge of marketing management and strategy. Molly is very active in university, college, and department service. For example, on the university level, she serves as a reviewer for grant proposals for students seeking funding for their study-abroad opportunities. On the college level, Molly organizes the WCOB New Faculty Orientation. Finally, on the department level, Molly serves on the Peer Review Committee. Molly maintains a heavier service load than required; this extra service frees-up other members of the Marketing Department for research. In conclusion, Molly is an optimistic, positive force in the Marketing Department, contributing and encouraging citizenship and social justice."

I was the mentor for two senior honors theses one of which garnered a SURF grant. Over the past 5 years I have had 7 students receive SURF Grants. I am the mentor for 4 seniors this year and one of them received a SURF Grant as well. In addition I serve on 2 Fulbright senior honors thesis committees and am the second reader for about a dozen more. \n\nThe Associated Student Government and the Residents Interhall Congress named me as an Outstanding Faculty at their 13th Annual Faculty Appreciation Banquet.\n\nI have taken on a new preparation recently, The Nation Model United Nations Conference in New York City, which we took 24 of our students to New York City in early April. Our group garnered some of the most prestigious awards at the conference. These included:\n-Distinguished Delegation (for the entire University of Arkansas team)\n-Essentially, we placed in the second place group of universities of the total of 175 universities from around the world represented by 2,500 students!\nThere were 7 universities in each of the top 3 categories.\n\nOutstanding Delegation: Arms Trade Treaty Working Group (Nick Kennedy and Brock Thomas)\nThere were approximately 120 students in this working group.\n\nOutstanding Delegate: Matt Seubert for the African Union Working Group. \nThere were approximately 100 students in this working group.\n\nNow for 2013: I will teach 5 classes during the Spring and 4 during the Fall semester. I am also responsible for the Correspondence Study Classes (both Prins of Macro and Prins of Micro) each offered during the Spring, Summer and Fall sessions. In addition I will conduct the 15th year of the Japan Study Abroad Program during the first half of summer. Upon my return I'll teach 2 classes during the second half of the summer.\n\nThis will mean that I am responsible to teach a total of 57 hours for the department this calendar year of 2013. I will be teaching several of the Honors sections of the prins classes that I really enjoy. In addition, we are utilizing the Economic Supplemental Instruction ESI in my honors principles classes. I believe that the ESI program is succeeding, as it is a good springboard for our graduate students to transit into the classroom, which seems to be the inevitability.\n\nI certainly enjoy teaching and hope to keep my performance at the highest possible level."

The Honors College of the University determines which entering students will receive fellowships or other forms of scholarships. We interviewed each of the prospects and determined which would be bestowed a fellowship and who would receive a Chancellors scholarship. The students were simply excellent and the decisions were reasoned but challenging to make. \n\nMy work on The Honors College Study Abroad Scholarship Selection Committee continues.\n\nI have continued to serve on the Honors College Truman Scholarship Prep Committee.

The Nation Model United Nations project has added to these duties in another realm.  Overseeing my component of the ESI has allowed me to enjoy a particular type of externality, namely mentoring prospective teachers for the future.  So far, the ESI\u2019s are doing a very good job.  I hope that this will be the general case in the future and not just an aberration of these particular individuals.  Should someone truly not like to teach, then there is precious little that anyone can do to improve their chances of conveying knowledge to our undergraduates.  If we choose wisely, meaning that we have ESI\u2019s that would like to teach and work with our undergraduates, then our chances of success increase remarkably.  I hope this will be the direction that the department pursues with our graduate students concerning this activity.\n\nI completed my term as the Director of the Walton Honors Program at the end of the Spring semester.  This was a pretty time consuming task.  There were too many duties of this position to list here.\n\n"

(They selected eight cases out of ten discussed during the semester.) The cases used in this course were of considerable length, ranging from a minimum of 7 pages to a maximum of 30 pages. Consequently, preparation required a considerable amount of student effort. It has been my experience that the only way to make students analyze cases in advance is to require written case analyses. \n\nCase Discussion\n\tMuch of student learning occurs during case discussions in class. Consequently, points were awarded for students\u2019 contributions to these case discussions. Such contributions included making insightful comments, asking thoughtful questions, helping to focus complicated ideas, suggesting reasonable alternatives, and being willing to try out new ideas. Case discussion points were not rewarded for simply attending the class.\n\nDuring each case discussion, one of the student teams was designated as the official \u201cobserver for the day.\u201d This team was charged with monitoring the class discussion and awarding case discussion points to those who participated. They were also asked to report on the quality of the case discussion at the beginning of the next class. Up to ten points could be awarded per student per day. The observation team did not participate in the discussion on that day. Each student team served as observers for two of the ten case discussions.\n\n"

First they have to work on putting together a \"COUNTRY BINDER\" as a homework assignment. In this binder they have to collect, organize and post all country economic data graphs and figures of a number of economic variables that are used throughout the semester (GDP, money supply, inflation, exchange rate, balance of payments data, consumption, investment, government expenditures, government overall budget, interest rates). The data must be collected for a 10 years period and for a given country, the students select the period and the country they want to study.\n\nThroughout the semester they are asked to bring to class all materials used in the elaboration of their \"Country Report\" (newspaper and magazine articles, academic papers, official documents from government institutions and international institutions like the IMF and the World Bank).  \n\nTheir \"COUNTRY REPORT\" is a document that could be classified as a term paper. In this paper the students have to present an in-depth discussion of their country, not only with respect to economics, but they should touch on general facts about the country, like social and political issues, as well as development. \n\nAt the end of the semester, the students have to read all of the country reports and have to prepare for a discussion about these reports. The idea is to have questions about each country and have the group who worked on the specific country answer the question. Each group submits a set of questions for all the other groups and I select a set of questions to be discussed in class for each group. I called this \"COUNTRY FINAL Q and A sessions\". The questions and answers have to be backed up by the theoretical and empirical arguments discussed in class and have to be taken seriously (the questions and answers are part of the grade for the project)\n\nDue to the complexity of the COUNTRY PROJECT, which includes the data gathering, the country report and the country Q&A session, the students are asked to work in groups. The size of these groups is usually between four and five students. Given that I have the Q&A sessions at the end of the semester, I have to dedicate at least 2 classes for presentations. And since the students have worked hard throughout the semester, I feel that it is only fair to give each Q&A session for each paper 10-20 minutes to ask and answer questions. Additionally, I ask one last question for each group. Having groups of 4 or 5 in a class that has between 20 and 30 students, keeps the number of groups in a range that is consistent with having two (sometimes 2 1\/2) classes for final presentations. \n\nThe students have until the second class of the second week of classes to select their group members and the country they wish to follow. If some students do not have a group by then, they are incorporated into one by the end of that class (always trying to let the students sort out who goes into which group). I look at the proposed countries and make a decision on whether these countries are good country project candidates, in the sense of data availability and recent events (the idea is to have countries for which there is data availability and also to have countries that provide good cases for the topics covered in class). As the semester progresses and the material is covered, the students are asked to get the data for different economic variables and they have to analyze the data according to some theoretical based argument. These are not homework assignments but they have to be included in the binder. For example, there is theory that states that higher interest rates, with respect to that of a foreign country, lead to a lower exchange rate. The students get interest rate and exchange rate data for their country and a foreign country used as benchmark (usually the US) and try to identify the periods where the data is consistent\/inconsistent with the theory. These findings should be included in their country report and final country presentation, and explanations should be given for the consistencies or inconsistencies observed between data and theory. This analysis should be a formal analysis using references (newspapers and magazines articles, other theories, academic papers) to back up arguments.\n\nThe students can access the International Financial Statistics (from the International Monetary Fund) through the library (online) and the students can use this database to get all the necessary data. If for some reason the data is not in this database the students are asked to find other sources (but they should never buy other databases). Usually the missing data can be downloaded through the internet from the web pages of the central bank or some other government organization that is in charge of country statistics. \n\n\nThe countries covered during this semester included the following:\n\nUS\nTurkey\nBrazil\nNorway\nTurkey 95\nSpain\nArgentina\nSouth Korea\nJapan\nGermany\nSaudi Arabia\nNigeria\nSweden\n\n\n"

The primary objective of the course is to provide an introduction to the advanced empirical and analytical accounting research literature from an aggregate markets framework.  New developments in the traditional areas of finance\u201dbehavioral finance, theory of rational investor portfolio choice, interpretation and determination of security prices in markets driven by irrational investor behavior, efficient corporate decision making\u201dare approached from the perspective of a single integrating paradigm derived from economic theory integrated with analytical finance models.   As the instructor, I prepare lectures that synthesize and integrate the contemporaneous analytical and empirical work in current topics to date.\n\nThe course also considers appropriate research design and statistical methods designed to detect the information content of accounting data, the efficiency of accounting method choice, earnings management, and efficient corporate decision making (investment, tax and financing) as it pertains to accounting issues related to minimizing the cost of equity capital.  We consider external monitoring by regulators and the impact of regulation effects as well as contracting costs. The topics consider all areas of capital markets research.  \n\nAlthough unusual in a doctoral seminar, I believe in preparing numerous handouts to illustrate various points to the students.   I personally spend four to six hours outside of class preparing for this seminar as it is critical for the doctoral student's development. Prepared detailed handouts on statistical tests. Read over fifty accounting articles (or working papers) and select from this group associated with economics, finance and accounting to update courses. Every semester, I prepared new analytical proofs that require 3-4 days to derive.  This semester, I prepared a handout that took four days to develop. This handout provides an integrated theoretical neoclassical economics and behavioral science framework that delineates the axiomatic assumptions and interdisciplinary theoretical linkage that underlies behavioral economics (Appendix A).   I focused on having the students understand the intuition and statistical as well as mathematical power of the model.  Having a strong statistical background is fundamental to capital markets research as the tests are complex.\n\n\tThe students do not take exams in an advanced doctoral seminar but consider practical application pilot projects that teach the sophisticated research methods of the discipline. The goal is to have them make progress on understanding and developing research agendas.\nStudents are required to develop a more detailed research proposal that is consistent with their dissertation area of interest.  Each student is required to work on an empirical financial accounting topic and prepare a paper by the end of the semester. The topic can be chosen by you or it can be an extension of work in your summer papers. Topic and extension must be approved by instructor.  You are expected to access at least one if not more of the data sources: COMPUSTAT, CRSP, and IBES tapes and\/or others to get the data needed for the analysis.\n\nEach semester, we include a module of readings associated with the students' specified interest when it is known. The instructor provided an overview.  This formal pre-proposal (pilot project) is presented to other students and faculty on the last day of class if complete. The research design must address a relevant accounting issue, and be feasible in terms of data collection. It is the expectation that this research design will be actually executed and the project will be defended within one term.  Students meet weekly with the instructor to be sure progress is being made.  In the best case scenario, this pilot project will lead to an area of dissertation work and a published article. \n\t\t\t\t\nIn addition, students complete interim group projects that illustrate statistical methodology, theoretical development of research questions etc. Nearly all aspects of the research process are covered. \n\nIn addition students are exposed to the review process.  The paper assigned will be in your dissertation area. The critique is designed to simulate the experience of serving as a peer reviewer for an academic journal, as a discussant for a paper at an academic conference, or as a colleague providing feedback to another scholar.  A good critique includes accurate identification of the key features of the paper, constructive criticism of the work, assessment of the authors' conclusions given the evidence; and where possible, specific suggestions for improvement.  The instructor proposes a structured format similar to the journal requirement. Students are also given materials to read on the review process (Appendix C)\n"

Grading is based on the use of various HTML capabilities and overall appearance of the web pages.  The purpose of the second assignment is to get the student web pages made in assignment #1 uploaded to the \"comp\" server. Accomplishing this will allow anyone with a browser and internet access to view the web page made in homework assignment #1.  The purpose of the third assignment is to create a database that will keep track of products and product categories, analyze the data to give the owner the information that she needs in the form of queries and reports.  Using Microsoft Access, the student's create a database, import data, insert data, create a form, create a query and create a report that summarizes the information acquired from the analyzed data.  The purpose of the last assignment is to create a resume and cover letter to apply for a genuine information systems (or major appropriate) entry level position of your choice.  As part of this assignment the student is required to upload his or her resume to the Walton College of Business E-Recruiting system. The purpose of the fourth assignment was using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to create an evaluation form model for decision support.  The model was used to evaluate several computer leases, make a selection decision, provide justification for the decision in a memo and summarize the results."

Each group will be required to identify a stream of auditing research (e.g., research on the determinants of audit quality, factors leading to restatements, benefits\/costs of internal control evaluations, etc.) and address issues such as the following:  What are the key findings of the research?  How\/should the findings impact the way that audits are performed?  What are the market implications of the findings?  Do the findings have public policy implications?  What questions remain unanswered by the research?\n\nThe list is not meant to be exhaustive.  I am willing to consider a broad range of topics.  However, all topic proposals must be approved in advance.  Each group will be required to provide a one-page proposal describing the topic they have selected (see attached course schedule for due date).  Topics will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis - duplicate topics will not be permitted.  At the end of the semester, each group will provide a 3-4 page report and a 20 minute in-class presentation.  The written report should include in-text citations where needed and a complete reference list.  I expect that all work associated with this assignment will be fairly distributed - \u201cfree riding\u201d (not making a fair contribution) in group work is academic dishonesty because the work is represented as the result of all members\u2019 contributions and it will not be tolerated.  It is your responsibility to inform me if issues relating to \u201cfree riding\u201d arise.\n"

First they have to work on putting together a \"COUNTRY BINDER\" as a homework assignment. In this binder they have to collect, organize and post all country economic data graphs and figures of a number of economic variables that are used throughout the semester (GDP, money supply, inflation, exchange rate, balance of payments data, consumption, investment, government expenditures, government overall budget, interest rates). The data must be collected for a 10 years period and for a given country, the students select the period and the country they want to study.\n\nThroughout the semester they are asked to bring to class all materials used in the elaboration of their \"Country Report\" (newspaper and magazine articles, academic papers, official documents from government institutions and international institutions like the IMF and the World Bank).  \n\nTheir \"COUNTRY REPORT\" is a document that could be classified as a term paper. In this paper the students have to present an in-depth discussion of their country, not only with respect to economics, but they should touch on general facts about the country, like social and political issues, as well as development. \n\nAt the end of the semester, the students have to read all of the country reports and have to prepare for a discussion about these reports. The idea is to have questions about each country and have the group who worked on the specific country answer the question. Each group submits a set of questions for all the other groups and I select a set of questions to be discussed in class for each group. I called this \"COUNTRY FINAL Q and A sessions\". The questions and answers have to be backed up by the theoretical and empirical arguments discussed in class and have to be taken seriously (the questions and answers are part of the grade for the project)\n\nDue to the complexity of the COUNTRY PROJECT, which includes the data gathering, the country report and the country Q&A session, the students are asked to work in groups. The size of these groups is usually between four and five students. Given that I have the Q&A sessions at the end of the semester, I have to dedicate at least 2 classes for presentations. And since the students have worked hard throughout the semester, I feel that it is only fair to give each Q&A session for each paper 10-20 minutes to ask and answer questions. Additionally, I ask one last question for each group. Having groups of 4 or 5 in a class that has between 20 and 30 students, keeps the number of groups in a range that is consistent with having two (sometimes 2 1\/2) classes for final presentations. \n\nThe students have until the second class of the second week of classes to select their group members and the country they wish to follow. If some students do not have a group by then, they are incorporated into one by the end of that class (always trying to let the students sort out who goes into which group). I look at the proposed countries and make a decision on whether these countries are good country project candidates, in the sense of data availability and recent events (the idea is to have countries for which there is data availability and also to have countries that provide good cases for the topics covered in class). As the semester progresses and the material is covered, the students are asked to get the data for different economic variables and they have to analyze the data according to some theoretical based argument. These are not homework assignments but they have to be included in the binder. For example, there is theory that states that higher interest rates, with respect to that of a foreign country, lead to a lower exchange rate. The students get interest rate and exchange rate data for their country and a foreign country used as benchmark (usually the US) and try to identify the periods where the data is consistent\/inconsistent with the theory. These findings should be included in their country report and final country presentation, and explanations should be given for the consistencies or inconsistencies observed between data and theory. This analysis should be a formal analysis using references (newspapers and magazines articles, other theories, academic papers) to back up arguments.\n\nThe students can access the International Financial Statistics (from the International Monetary Fund) through the library (online) and the students can use this database to get all the necessary data. If for some reason the data is not in this database the students are asked to find other sources (but they should never buy other databases). Usually the missing data can be downloaded through the internet from the web pages of the central bank or some other government organization that is in charge of country statistics. \n\n\nThe countries covered during this semester included the following:\n\nJapan\nGermany\nIsrael\nBrazil\nArgentina\nThailand\nCanada\nChina\nRussia\nSouth Korea\nCosta Rica\nChile\nPoland\nJordan\n"

Here are two examples:\n\nDuring the Adidas, Nike, and Reebok case we discuss the economic reasons for \"sourcing.\" These include tax advantages, cheaper labor, and lower fixed costs. The reason that lowering fixed costs is important is because it lowers the break-even point. Here, we spend some time lecturing about the break-even point; we put up the graphs and then teach our students how to calculate the break-even point in dollars and in units. We also discuss the break-even point in terms of profit and then also in units with a target profit included.\n\nFrom here we discuss some of the key characteristics of competing in an oligopolistic industry. These include things like, there are a very few sellers, entry and exit is more difficult, product and brand differentiation (with a focus on brand identity) is important, and interdependency between firms. With the last characteristic, due to the interdependency, if you want to compete successfully in the industry, you need to keep up. In other words, if your competitors have found a way to lower the break-even point, then you need to use it too. This is why it is so hard to change sourcing.\n\nThen, we say, \"Let's take a look at sourcing from a philosophical (ethics) and sociological perspective.\" Here we draw on a number of human rights organizations including Global Exchange. These organizations are asking for six areas of reform at all overseas factories: 1. protecting workers who speak out about conditions; 2. investigating worker complaints and installing independent and confidential monitoring procedures; 3. providing decent wages; 4. scheduling reasonable working hours; 5. providing safe and healthy workplaces; and 6. respecting workers' rights for freedom of association.\n\nThen we ask the class, \"Why are sociological and economic perspectives different? Don't we all want what is best for the world?\" This leads to all kinds of opinions and discussion and we try to help them become aware that they will be making very difficult decisions as corporate leaders.\n\nJust very briefly, a second example includes our discussions as to the approaches marketers take when targeting teenage segments. Here, we show them the PBS Frontline Special \"Merchants of Cool\" and try to get a discussion going after. From a marketing perspective, market share is important and here we have a very large demographic group with disposable income. But what do parents think? We ask our students, \"Tell me what your grandmother would think about this.\" We listen and then ask, \"Why are there such different opinions?\" Again, we try to teach them that making the \"correct\" decision from the perspective of one stakeholder may be the \"wrong\" decision from the perspective of another stakeholder. As society becomes more and more complex, the number of stakeholders and constituencies increases and decisions only become harder and harder. We teach them that thinking about issues from multiple perspectives increases tolerance and often critiques an ethnocentric perspective. We try to make it clear that this is business ethics and that it is important for the long term success of your company."

A sign stating that that the students should help themselves was placed beside the box.  Two pre-recruited student helpers sat in the back of the room and recorded their observations as other students entered the room. \n\nAfter several minutes I enter and ask the general class for their observations.  I then inform the class that we had two hidden observers, and asked for their observations.  Finally, we watch the video footage.  Throughout the course of the following lecture we are able to compare the accuracy of the class' memory, versus the accuracy of the observers, versus the accuracy of the video camera.  We also are able to have concrete examples of the different types of observational research (i.e. disguised versus undisguised, human versus mechanical.)\n\nProjective Techniques\nStudents act as focus group participants and try out several projective techniques, including word association, balloon techniques and the board of director's technique.\n\nGarbology\nTo illustrate a form of Retail Anthropology and show students how much a researcher can learn from what people discard, I ask several different friends to collect 'sanitized' trash for me for a week.  These households will range from single, older women to young families.  \n\nOn the day we discuss different types of Retail Anthropology, I bring the bags of trash to class.  The students are divided into groups and each group is then asked to analyze a bag of trash and create a profile of the household the trash came from.  Each group then shares their findings with the class.\n\nThis typically leads to a very lively discussion about how much they were able to discover about each household as well as the ethics of digging through people's trash.\n"

This integration was completed by the instructor over several months. If you would like a complete reference list, please see me.  \n\nA THEORETICAL ECONOMICS AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK: \n\nCapital Markets Context\n\n\t\nOverview:  This theoretical integration has the potential to foster a conceptual understanding of the linkages and differences between experimental economic studies and individual-choice laboratory methodologies. It also permits us a discussion of game theoretical constructs that can underlie both laboratory methodologies.  Experimental markets, individual-choice laboratory and game theory methodologies are widely associated with various types of accounting research discussed in this course.\n\n1. This integration and delineation of the axiomatic assumptions associated with neoclassical economics and behavioral science in one framework can be useful to accounting researchers as they attempt to develop theoretical constructs that guide their research.  Samuelson [2005] provides an insightful literature review and analysis of the importance of integrating economic theory and experiments.  \n\n2.  To understand the interdisciplinary theoretical constructs that underlie behavioral economics, we start with classic definitions in the psychology and neoclassical economics literature and discuss the axiomatic assumptions underlying the field of behavioral economics. \n\n3. \tIn this summary, I this discussion with an analysis of the similarities and differences among experimental markets, individual-choice laboratory and game theory methodologies associated with various types of accounting research.  \n\n4.  \tFirst I focus on psychology.  Psychology is an extremely broad field, encompassing many different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. A general definition of psychology is that it is an academic and applied field involving the study of the human mind, brain, and behavior.  \n\n5.   \tCognitive psychology is the school of psychology that examines internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language.  The main concern of cognitive psychology is how information received from our senses is processed by the brain and how this processing directs how we behave [Anderson 1980].\n\n6. \tCognition theory or human perception can be used to analyze the decision-making process. Decision-making is the cognitive process leading to the selection of a course of action among alternatives. Therefore, decision-making is a reasoning process that can be rational or irrational, and can be based on explicit assumptions or tacit assumptions.  In general, rationality of the individual decision maker (DM) is not assumed, as personal cognitive biases are possible. \n\n7.\tCognitive bias is any of a wide range of observer effects identified in cognitive science and social psychology including very basic statistical, social attribution, and memory errors that are common to all human beings.  \n\n8. \t In addition to bounded rationality, there are three main axiomatic assumptions on decision-making or market irregularities that have led to a blending of cognitive psychology with neoclassical economics to establish the field of behavioral economics [Shefrin 2002]:\n\nHeuristics: People often make decisions based on approximate rules of thumb, not strictly rational analyses.\n\nFraming: The way a problem or decision is presented to the decision maker will affect their action.\n\nMarket inefficiencies: There are explanations for observed market outcomes that are contrary to rational expectations and market efficiency. These include mispricings, non-rational decision-making, and return anomalies [Kent, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam 1998]. \n\n9. \tTo understand the basic linkage of cognitive psychology to neoclassical economics theory, we consider the underlying behavioral assumptions.  Neoclassical economics relates supply and demand to an individual's rationality and his or her ability to maximize utility or profit based on the tenets of rational choice, perfect information and expected utility theory. \n\n10. \tIn neoclassical economic theory, it is assumed that decision makers, given their knowledge of utilities, alternatives, and outcomes, can compute which alternative will yield the greatest subjective (expected) utility.  In short, neoclassical economics rests on three assumptions, although certain branches of neoclassical theory may have different approaches [Becker, 1976; Hodgson, 1993]:\n\n1. People have rational preferences among outcomes that can be identified and associated with a value.\n2. Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits.\n3. People act independently on the basis of full and relevant information.\n\nThe assumption of perfect information implies efficient markets.  In mainstream economics, under some well-explored conditions, markets tend to move towards equilibrium. Efficient markets work through ensuring the establishment of accurate price and incentive structures. Any deviation from equilibrium leads to instantaneous adjustment via the price system, the only equilibrating mechanism.\n\nIMPORTANT POINT: \n\nDepartures from neoclassical economics assumptions arise from the field of behavioral economics and finance. Neoclassical economics is largely based on a few simplifying assumptions, many of which have been challenged over the last few years. Relaxing neoclassic economic assumptions, one of the most important studies in the development of the behavioral economics field was written by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979. Their article, \"Prospect Theory: Decision-making Under Risk\", used cognitive psychological techniques to explain a number of documented anomalies in rational economic decision-making involving risk.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nIn short, behavioral economics integrates the field of cognitive psychology and departs from one or more of the neoclassical assumptions underlying the theory of rational behavior.  The field attempts to understand and explain how human emotions or departures from rationality influence economic agents in any economic arena [see for example, Camerer 1995,1997, Camerer, Loewenstein, and Rabin 2003].  In contrast, behavioral finance attempts to understand and explain how human emotions influence investors in their decision-making process and does not assume perfect investor rationality [Kent, Hirshleifer, and Teoh.  2002].  The field of behavioral finance proposes psychology-based theories to explain aggregate stock market anomalies. Within behavioral finance, it is assumed that the information structure (including accounting) and the characteristics of market participants systematically influence individuals' investment decisions as well as market outcomes [Shleifer 1999].\n\t \n \nAppendix B\n\nACC 6433\nCourse Orientation-Callahan\n\nFormal lectures will be offered by the instructor as an introduction to a major area.  A seminar format will be used with a designated student presenter or group of presenters. After the first week, we will discuss 3-4 selected main empirical papers each week. It is expected that the background reading be completed before reading the main presentation papers. Please read the assigned papers carefully before class and be prepared to discuss the following for each empirical reading (see suggestions for the theory papers below): \n \n1. \tThe research question and the theoretical or intuitive constructs used to motivate it. Why is the question interesting (or uninteresting)? Is the question descriptive rather than predictive? \n \n2. \tAre there well-specified alternatives to the hypotheses being forwarded? How compelling is the logic or intuition used to develop the hypotheses? \n \n3. \tWhat is the study's research design? Consider sample selection and empirical tests and be an expert on all table analysis. All tables should be enlarged for readability and available for discussion and viewing in your presentation format.  This format is consistent with presenting at professional conferences.  \n \n4. \tHow well is the research design tied to the research question? To what extent is the design capable of distinguishing between alternative hypotheses? \n \n5.\t What difficulties arise in drawing inferences from the empirical work? \n \n6. \tWhat are the paper's major results? How do the authors interpret these results? How do you interpret them? \n \n7. \tWhat research questions are raised by the paper's results? What unresolved research questions related to the paper could be investigated? How would you address the unresolved questions and why? \n \nNOTE: As a presenter, enrolled students must distribute to the instructor and other class members a individually generated summary for each assigned reading.  The summary must describe what issue the study examines, why the issues are of interest, how the specific issue is examined, and what we learned from the study.   Zach has completed an excellent summary that you may wish to review.  It is enclosed for your reference with his permission. It is the file labeled 02-26 De Angelo.doc.\n \nIn addition:   Formal presentations must be formal PowerPoint lectures and an example will be provided on the first day of class with the associated article.  \n \nYou will need to email the instructor and class with your two (2) documents (detailed above) by 8:00am on class day. \n\nAs a basis for grade determination, please place hard copies of the same (summary and PowerPoint-3 slides per page handout format) in the instructor's mailbox at or prior to the time indicated.  You will also find these documents to be a useful review for your summer accounting comprehensives.  Use good judgment and summarizing the review article for the first day.  \n \nResearch Module Instruction\nAcc 6433\nCallahan\n\nPanel A Instructor Introduction\/Summary Example\n\nFrom: Callahan, Carolyn \nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2006 8:55 PM\nTo: Webb, Zach; Romi, Andrea; Waymire, Tammy\nSubject: Quotes and Notes that are a summary for Today's Work--\n\nMuch of economic and financial theory is based on the notion that individuals act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process. However, researchers have uncovered a surprisingly large amount of evidence that this is frequently not the case. Dozens of examples of irrational behavior and repeated errors in judgement have been documented in academic studies. \nPeter L. Bernstein in Against The Gods states that the evidence \"reveals repeated patterns of irrationality, inconsistency, and incompetence in the ways human beings arrive at decisions and choices when faced with uncertainty.\"\n A field known as \"behavioral finance\" has evolved that attempts to better understand and explain how emotions and cognitive errors influence investors and the decision-making process. Many researchers believe that the study of psychology and other social sciences can shed considerable light on the efficiency of financial markets as well as explain many stock market anomalies, market bubbles, and crashes. As an example, some believe that the out performance of value investing (recall Warren Buffet) results from investor's irrational overconfidence in exciting growth companies and from the fact that investors generate pleasure and pride from owning growth stocks. Many researchers (not all) believe that these humans flaws are consistent, predictable, and can be exploited for profit.\n\"In summary, people trade for both cognitive and emotional reasons. They trade because they think they have information when they have nothing but noise, and they trade because trading can bring the joy of pride. Trading brings pride when decisions turn out well, but it brings regret when decisions do not turn out well. Investors try to avoid the pain of regret by avoiding the realization of losses, employing investment advisors as scapegoats, and avoiding stocks of companies with low reputations.\"\nMeir Statman (\"Investor Psychology and Market Inefficiencies,\" Equity Markets and Valuation Methods, The Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts, 1988)\n\n\n\n\nPanel B Practitioner Article that Illustrates the issues associated with the Cost of Capital Module\n\n\n \t \n \n\t \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \nCorrective Lenses\n \n\nSome experts contend that options-pricing models give a better view of cost of capital than CAPM. \n\nRonald Fink, CFO Magazine\n\nMay 01, 2003\nQuick, what's your company's cost of capital? Not sure? That's OK \u0097 you're far from alone. Finance executives have long wrestled with that question when establishing hurdle rates for investments. During the last throes of the bull market, with capital dirt-cheap, it didn't much matter. But the bear market has made capital dear once again, and brought the question of its exact cost back to center stage.\nCalculating the price of debt is not the problem: subtract the prevailing interest rate on Treasury bonds from the rate on a company's equivalently timed debt, and the resulting spread will serve as a perfectly reliable measure of investors' expectations that the company will default on those obligations. That spread can then be used to establish the returns an investment must produce to satisfy bondholders that the risk of default is worth taking.\nThe rub comes in trying to reckon the cost of a company's equity. There is simply no way \u0097 yet \u0097 of definitively measuring the risk that a company won't be able to satisfy shareholders as well as bondholders, who after all have first dibs on a company's assets in the event of bankruptcy. In the absence of a better alternative, for nearly 40 years many academics and finance executives have accepted the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), or some variation of it, as an adequate means of approximating the cost of equity.\nRecently, however, proponents of a new methodology have claimed that companies can use options-pricing theory to estimate their cost of equity, and therefore capital, to a far greater degree of accuracy than ever before. Is it time to throw away the old yardstick?\nBeta Blockers\nIntroduced in 1963 by Stanford University professor William Sharpe, and building on the pioneering portfolio-optimization theory of Harry Markowitz, CAPM was designed to help investors develop a diversified portfolio of assets. (Both Sharpe and Markowitz won Nobel prizes for their work.) But CAPM also found its way into corporate offices as a standard formula for establishing minimum acceptable returns for capital allocation of all kinds, including acquisitions, product development, and restructuring projects.\nThe trouble is, CAPM isn't particularly well suited for corporate purposes, as both theorists and practitioners have come to acknowledge. \"A square peg in a round hole\" is how Tony D. Yeh, a principal in the San Francisco-based consulting firm Pacifica Strategic Advisors LLC, describes CAPM's application to hurdle rates. He's not alone. \"I don't think there's any question that CAPM is not appropriate\" to calculate hurdle rates, declares Robert Reilly, managing director of Chicago \u0097 based consulting firm Willamette Management Associates.\nWhat's wrong with CAPM? Yeh, Reilly, and others say the model's basic flaw is the way it calculates the equity risk premium \u0097 the amount of return that equity investors require above and beyond the rate available on bonds.\nIn calculating this premium, CAPM relies on a measure known as beta, which multiplies the volatility of an asset's price by its correlation, or the degree to which the price moves in line with prices of other assets. The result works well when the goal is to select assets that serve to diversify a portfolio. After all, an asset's price may be hugely volatile but pose little risk for a diversified portfolio if it is totally uncorrelated to prices of other assets. (Indeed, a volatile asset will actually decrease a portfolio's overall risk if other assets' price movements are in exactly the opposite direction.)\nBut because of the way CAPM takes correlation into account, it fails to measure the overall risk of the asset \u0097 and by extension, the value of an investment in it. That, experts say, is a significant drawback for corporate managers, who are paid to ensure that a company's assets do better than match average returns. While it might once have made sense to consider each of a company's investments in terms of how it fit into a diverse portfolio, the current consensus is that managers should focus on investments that capitalize on a core business competency.\n\nSharpe himself disputes the notion that CAPM isn't suitable for setting hurdle rates. He says managers who focus on company-specific risk are likely to set hurdle rates too high, depriving investors of opportunities they would prefer that the company exploit.\nUp Close and Flawed\nYet CAPM clearly produces some odd results. Look, for instance, at Atlanta \u0097 based home-improvement retailer Home Depot, which sported a beta of 1.6 in 1995. That figure suggested that the company's stock was more than half again as risky as the overall market and more than twice as risky as, for instance, Wolohan Lumber Co., a small competitor based in Saginaw, Michigan, whose beta was only 0.75 at the time.\nConsidering risk strictly on the basis of beta, however, would have missed the fact that Home Depot's profit margins were steadily rising while Wolohan's were shrinking. Three years later, in fact, both companies had a beta of 0.70. Whatever its virtues as a historical measure of risk, beta, as this and other examples demonstrate, has no particular predictive value.\nAs a result of beta's unreliability, many companies simply ignore CAPM, choosing an arbitrary hurdle rate based on a gut-level sense of what all of a company's various investments should earn. A former finance executive at Boston \u0097 based Gillette Co. says that until recently the shaving-products company adhered to a hurdle rate of 20 percent, no matter what type of project was under consideration.\nCompanies that do use beta frequently adjust their hurdle rates to reflect such factors as a company's size, financial leverage, and the specific type of investment involved. In fact, Willamette's Reilly says such adjustments are critical. \"When you get to investment-specific issues,\" he says, \"you have to apply some judgment.\"\nThat's clearly the tack taken by Stamford, Connecticut \u0097 based office-equipment maker Pitney Bowes Inc. Instead of one across-the-board rate, Pitney uses a range of 10 percent to 12 percent based on the returns the company has generated in the past and has led investors to expect, says Dessa Bokides, the company's treasurer. Within that range, it makes adjustments based on such considerations as where a particular business stands in relation to its cycle. But, says Bokides, the process doesn't involve \"a huge mathematical calculation.\"\nA New Option\nStill, new methodologies based on options pricing aim to reduce the amount of judgment involved, and as a result are drawing more interest from finance executives.\nOne such approach has been dubbed the Market-derived Capital Pricing Model (MCPM). This model was formulated by Yeh and James J. McNulty, president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and refined by William S. Schultz, a professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western University, and Michael H. Lubatkin, a professor at the University of Connecticut's School of Business.\nInstead of relying on adjustments to beta, MCPM uses options-pricing models to estimate the equity risk premium from a stock's volatility. In other words, the two methods have a much different approach to measuring risk: whereas CAPM uses both volatility and correlation to gauge it, MCPM focuses on volatility alone. In addition, MCPM adds the risk premium to the estimated yield of a company's debt, instead of the risk-free rate on Treasurys, to obtain its cost of equity. (Editor's note: to read more on how MCPM is calculated, go to the sidebar at the end of this article.)\nYeh says a growing number of companies are employing the methodology to set hurdle rates, though he says he can't disclose their identities. Another consultant reports that Procter & Gamble expressed interest in applying the approach not long after a Harvard Business Review article on MCPM appeared, in 2002. Home Depot CFO Carol Tom\u00e9 says her company uses both CAPM and an options-based approach to estimate its cost of capital, though she contends that setting hurdle rates under either is still \"more of an art than a science.\"\n\nYeh nevertheless contends that MCPM is more useful than a CAPM approach, even after adjustments to beta. For one thing, he says, MCPM is forward-looking, based as it is on traded financial instruments, whereas CAPM uses historical market data. As a result, he says, MCPM gives corporate managers a sense of the returns that investors actually expect, rather than what they've received in the past (which, after all, is no guarantee of future performance).\nWhat's more, says Yeh, a company's cost of capital changes with the daily price of its equity, and that's reflected in the prices of options, bonds, and other financial instruments. In contrast, beta involves an unchanging or \"static\" estimate based on the historical time frame used to measure returns. And while that estimate varies with the period chosen for analysis, any decision involving a historical period can't help but be arbitrary.\nCritical Assumptions\nThe new methodology is not without critics. Willamette's Reilly, for one, points out that cost estimates based on either method must be taken with a large grain of salt, because both CAPM and MCPM make important assumptions about returns on equity. \"The real question is how you make quantitative adjustments,\" he says.\nSome critics go further. Assumptions about returns, whether based on history or on expectations, are so critical as to render measurements of volatility with or without market correlation insignificant, these critics say. And they suggest that CFOs are better off paying less attention to hurdle rates than to their expectations that investments will grow earnings. Home Depot, for one, spends more time questioning its assumptions about returns on capital than its cost. \"Pick a number\" for the latter, recommends Tom\u00e9, and then \"grow the spread\" between your returns and that number.\nThe issue, ultimately, comes down to just how big a difference in a given company's cost of capital the two methods will produce. Home Depot, for its part, has found that the difference isn't very significant, according to Tom\u00e9, \"so why bother\" spending much time on the question, she asks.\nElsewhere, however, Pacifica finds the cost of equity varies much more widely under the two methods. While, for example, the consulting firm found little difference in the case of Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s 10-year cost of equity-9.7 percent under CAPM compared with 9.5 percent under MCPM-much wider variations were found at its competitors, Wal-Mart Stores and Target, and among such computer makers as Apple and Gateway.\nWhatever its merits, Pacifica's methodology is not without practical obstacles. It obviously isn't designed for small, privately held companies, and even many public companies lack options or bonds from which to derive a market-based calculation. Yeh responds that proxies for both are easy enough to find for most companies. Still, if a company has to compare itself with others to calculate its cost of equity under MCPM, it might as well adjust CAPM to take beta's flaws into account. \"There's lots of judgment involved anyway,\" says Reilly.\nYeh concedes that MCPM is just a starting point for allocating capital. All he's really claiming is that the financial markets represent a better place to begin the process than CAPM. And finance executives of companies for which the two models produce widely varying cost estimates have good reason to put his claim to the test.\nSidebar: How MCPM Works\nThe methodology developed by Pacifica Strategic Advisors LLC to calculate the equity risk premium for purposes of estimating a company's cost of capital is based on five steps:\n1. Calculate the stock's forward break-even price. To find out how well the share price must perform to compensate equity investors for their additional risk, Pacifica first determines the minimal capital gains that they will require over a given term to do as well as bondholders. That gain equals the yield on the company's debt minus any dividends likely to be paid during the period.\n\n2. Estimate the stock's future volatility. Next Pacifica determines how likely it is that a company will fail to reach the break-even price. It does that by analyzing the prices of options on the company's stock, using an options-pricing model.\n3. Calculate the cost of the risk implied. Pacifica then combines its estimate of volatility with the forward break-even price to determine the price investors would be prepared to pay to insure against the chances that their shares will fall below the forward break-even price. This premium reflects the extra risk of equity over debt.\n4. Annualize the premium. Next, Pacifica expresses the dollar cost of that equity risk premium as an annual percentage.\n5. Create a term structure of equity. Finally, Pacifica repeats the calculation for different intervals to create a term structure of equity, which it then uses with the corporate bond term structure to determine the appropriate weighted cost of capital for a given project.\nDueling Models\nThe Methodology developed by San Francisco-based Pacifica Strategic Advisors LLC to calculate a company's cost of equity can produce values that differ greatly from those determined using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). To illustrate, CFO asked Pacifica to calculate the cost of equity for companies in two different industries using CAPM and its own approach, known as the Market-derived Capital Pricing Model (MCPM). We chose retailers and computer makers because they stand at opposite ends of the economic spectrum: retailers' results are heavily dependent on trends in consumer consumption, which in turn are highly sensitive to broad economic developments, whereas the computer makers' business is driven by capital spending, which is subject primarily to trends in corporate productivity. The object is to demonstrate the widest possible range in cost under either method. As explained at greater length in the accompanying story, CAPM uses a measure known as beta to set equity risk premiums, and that measure reflects two factors: a stock's volatility and its correlation to the market. In contrast, Pacifica's model uses an options-pricing model to set equity risk premiums, a method that focuses on company-specific risk.\n \n\nExplanation: The CAPM vs. MCPM analysis allows for the comparison of company costs of capital, calculated based on the Market-derived Capital Pricing Model (MCPM), to be compared against a company cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Since the CAPM framework does not account for term structure, the CAPM value represents a \"long-term\" cost of equity. The company betas used are calculated from five years of data, daily sampling.

A researcher must know the underlying environmental assumptions and be prepared to defend why a suggested theoretical framework or methodology is appropriate for the research question posed.\n\n2.\tAccounting research is becoming more integrative in the current research environment.  It is rare to see an article in the major accounting journals that relies on a single theoretical or methodological paradigm in all aspects of the study. \n\n3.\tIn an efficient perfect market, the decision to recognize a disclosed amount conveys no new information. In such markets, the recognition decision should not have equity valuation effects.  Only decisions that change expected future cash flows to the firm can impact valuation. \n\n4.\tWhat is an efficient market?   The simplest definition is that equity market prices reflect all available information in a frictionless market.  We will expand this definition and examine the notion of \"frictions\" in more detail over the coming weeks. Explore the definition of a \"perfect market\".\n\n\n5.\tTests of market efficiency must be based on an asset-pricing model. If the evidence is against market efficiency, it may be because the market is inefficient, or it may be that the asset pricing model is incorrect.  Therefore \nall tests of market efficiency are joint tests:\n\na.\tDo we have the correct asset pricing model?\n\nb.\tGiven, the model is correct, is the market informationally efficient?  \n\n6.\tThe theory of Rational Expectations underlies the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.  This means investors (in market equilibrium) make their decisions based on mean and variance of return and act in a rational manner in terns of preferences.   They will demand more return if risk is increased.\n\n7.\tMore formally, according to rational expectations and efficient markets hypotheses, in equilibrium the risk-adjusted return on all investments should be equal, i.e., the return one may expect from a share of stock should exactly equal the return that can be had on any other financial instrument with similar risk characteristics. \n\n8.\tFurther, if any single financial instrument exhibits a higher risk-adjusted rate of return than others, investors can be expected to attempt to purchase that instrument, thereby causing its price to rise and its rate of return to fall. This suggests that it is not possible to systematically beat the market by picking a stock which will outperform the market. \n\n\n\n \nAppendix C\n\n \nYou might find this additional information useful... \nThis article cites 7 articles, 3 of which you can access free at: \nhttp:\/\/ajpadvan.physiology.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/27\/2\/47#BIBL \nThis article has been cited by 4 other HighWire hosted articles:\n \nA Systematic Guide to Reviewing a Manuscript \nJ.

Both rights are designed to provide protection from competition, and promise superior sales revenues as well as higher sales per store than could be realized from a non-franchised format. Recent U.S. Economic Census statistics for the franchise industry indicate increasing sales competition in the limited-service restaurant (LSR) sector. Since 1997, franchising has shown minimal growth in overall revenue, relatively low growth in sales per establishment, and a decline in share from 82 to 67 percent of overall limited-service restaurant revenues. Collectively, given these changes in structure, performance in terms of sales per establishment would, by mathematical necessity, trail that of alternative chains operating under unified ownership. An appropriate question is then, are these changes in share or sales per store attributable to gains made in non-franchised format competition, or to the competition among franchised competitors themselves?\nThis study uses 1997 and 2002 U.S. Economic Census data for sales per establishment measures of performance and examines the effects of market structure and concentration in a cross-sectional analysis of 55 metropolitan areas. The findings support traditional perspectives on market concentration, with four and eight firm concentration ratios of outlets and revenue being negatively related to sales per establishment, and as such serving as indicators of higher market competition or market saturation. However, in line with retail theory on competition (Ingene 1983), more diverse markets in which many franchised and non-franchised restaurants compete without the dominance of a few brands actually show above average performance.\nThe results indicate the existence of an institutional submarket within a broader market of limited-service restaurant types, where evidence for competition exists among only the leading franchised formats, with non-franchised formats exhibiting little or no effects on the overall market\u2019s sales per establishment. Potential entrants to a geographic market would benefit from evaluating the concentration of establishments among the leading formats, avoiding those with higher concentration, and be less discouraged by the number of restaurants, franchised or non-franchised, in the market.\nIn the franchise literature, he difference in franchisor versus franchisee sales performance has provided one explanation as to why more successful franchisee establishment may eventually be converted, or re-directed, into franchisor establishments (Oxenfeldt and Kelly 1968; Dant, Kaufmann, and Paswan 1992). Conversely, this study\u2019s evidence that growth in sales per establishment at all trade name LSRs lags behind other restaurant classifications, may provide an explanation for the sharp drop in the proportion of franchisor-owned establishments from 1997 to 2002. If concentration effects are reducing sales per establishment, those markets with the highest concentration of brands may also be the ones with sharpest re-conversion of franchisor to franchisee establishments.   \nThe results also show that the franchisor practice of increasing its share of outlets in a market may not only provide an increase in royalties, but serve as a deterrent to new entrants by reducing the anticipated sales per establishment. The practice can be effective if the franchisor is satisfied with the current number of franchisees and the franchisees can remain profitable at lower sales per establishment. Franchisors claiming to be experiencing a \u201cshortage\u201d of new franchisees need to examine the industry\u2019s practices that have created the fading differential advantages to becoming a franchisee."

                                        "value": "Phase I of an empirical study of potential uses of radio frequency identification (RFID) in the apparel supply chain was conducted in the fall of 2010.  This Phase of the research was designed to identify potential use cases for the use of RFID in an apparel supply chain and was funded by GS1 US and the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA).  The three-phase Supplier ROI study is commonly referred to as the Many-to-Many study.  Phase II will involve the measurement of ROI for select use cases identified in Phase I.  Phase III will study the effect of RFID on multiple suppliers simultaneously through an experiment.\n\nThe use cases were solicited from a wide range of companies, in several different countries, in many different types of facilities, and thus reveal where the industry collectively believes the greatest RFID benefits reside. Over a period of several months, we collected more than 60 use cases.\n\nThe findings of Phase I show that the potential benefits of item-level RFID in the apparel supply chain reach beyond the retailer and include apparel manufacturers. To begin, improved backroom-to-shelf replenishment and greater perpetual inventory (PI) accuracy, which result from RFID are shown to offer manufacturers the opportunity to increase top-line sales, due to higher product availability at the retail shelf. \n\nNot surprisingly, we found that RFID offers manufacturers the opportunity to improve inbound and outbound operations at all echelons. By implementing RFID, the supply chain can undertake scanning as each carton crosses the dock door at any location, which should substantially decrease the number of touches per carton. Because labor accounts for the largest portion of variable costs in an apparel distribution network, RFID is quite promising in terms of labor cost reduction. \n\nItem-level RFID tagging also offers apparel manufacturers the ability to audit the contents of each carton being shipped to its retail customers through an automated audit process, such that the apparel manufacturer can find errors in the redistribution process prior to those errors being found by the retail customer. This step ultimately reduces the deductions or chargebacks from the manufacturer\u2019s customers. \n\nIn addition, RFID can reduce inventory-related costs throughout the apparel supply chain by reducing ordering costs in the form of reduced shipping and receiving costs and fewer errors associated with shipping and receiving. As the ordering costs decline due to RFID business processes, the optimal time between orders shortens, and the optimal frequency of orders increases. Thus, cycle stock is reduced. Furthermore, RFID improves PI accuracy, which means that it reduces stock safety levels throughout the supply chain. \n\nOur use cases also suggest that is it reasonable to speculate not only that RFID could reduce safety stock and cycle stock but also that it would reduce the cost of carrying inventory per se, through the reduction of inventory risk, due to lower levels of shrinkage and obsolescence. \n\nFurthermore, the use cases suggest it is conceivable that tracking and tracing due to RFID will enable continuous quality improvement and thus result in fewer return-related costs and markdowns. By enabling tracking and tracing, RFID has the potential to reduce the cost of compliance with free trade agreements and improve customs processes. \n\nFor the most efficient overview of our findings, you can look at the Apparel Supply Chain Map of Use Cases Figure on the following page along with the Table following it, as a summary of our findings of use cases in the apparel supply chain.  The map of business use cases is identified according to the locations the participants indicated that RFID could potentially create benefits within their supply chain.  The legend to the numbers on the map can be found in the Table following the map.\n\nThe map allows a particular use case to appear at multiple locations on the supply chain map, because certain business problems for which RFID may solve or create benefits can occur at multiple points in the supply chain. Further examination reveals that the business use cases should enhance multiple business processes at each node in the supply chain. \n\nThere are many claims about RFID and how it will improve some process or reduce some cost but without explanation as to how it might do so or why it might do so.  In this white paper we explain the logic behind the how and why regarding selected causal relationship between RFID and various costs and processes.  These explanations extend beyond the apparel supply chain and are needed in our dialogs.\n\nFinally, in the last Section of the main body of the document, we discuss the need for visibility and how it improves performance.   We also discuss the need for adoption of standards around identification, capturing, and sharing, information.  This is critical for successful adoption and implementation.  In fact, we argue it is necessary for successful management of logistics and supply chain management, in general.  We recommend that industry consider not waiting until EPC-enabled RFID item-level tagging is fully implemented to begin implementing sharing standards around physical event data.  There are two reasons for this: (1) data is already available and not fully utilized, and (2) when EPC-enabled RFID grows in adoption, the benefit of the additional data that is captured can be realized more quickly.\n"

                                        "value": "In a world where most consumers\u2019 interaction with a company remains limited to a sales transaction, the idea of engaging consumers through relationship techniques appears promising. Recent research suggests that consumer participation in new product development (NPD) is one strategy that will promote innovation and improve consumer perceptions (Coviello and Joseph 2012; Hoyer et al. 2010; Kristensson, Matthing, and Johansson 2008). However, the feasibility of engaging every consumer with this or similar techniques is extremely low. Other practices such as focus groups and group interviews require financial and temporal resources that companies cannot afford to spend across their entire customer base. What, then, can be done to prevent consumers\u2019 perceptions that they are mere cogs in capitalistic attempts to maximize profits? If companies communicated the inclusion of a subset of consumers in their product development process, would that be enough to tangentially engage the rest of the consumer base as a whole? In other words, can the knowledge of consumer collaboration serve as a relationship proxy? Moreover, how might this information be used to overcome negative perceptions experienced in the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) communication domain?\n\nThe marketing mix, otherwise known as the \u2018four Ps\u2019 (Kotler and Levy 1969) and used to influence product acceptance, includes tools that are no longer solely under the control of the marketer. Until recently, this idea was considered iconoclastic and potentially dangerous. However, a company\u2019s sustainable competitive advantage fundamentally requires continuous innovation- a resource that is not limited to its employees. Seeking knowledge and creative ideas from consumers is one increasingly popular way to improve processes and performance. Consumers have become involved in marketing functions ranging from NPD to product promotion, yet many of these activities take place outside the company\u2019s reach. For example, in 2006, Unilever\u2019s Dove brand launched a 75 second YouTube video as part of the \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty\u201d social media endeavor. The online initiative garnered immediate results- three million views within the first quarter. Deighton (2008) indicates that the Dove campaign earned the brand an additional $1.2 billion in value, thus demonstrating the link between consumer engagement and firm performance. However, the fortunate result was in response to the risk Dove took to cede control of the discussion about the brand and its campaign. \u201cThe [Dove] campaign had touched a nerve with the public. Thousands of blogs and Internet chat forums showed a rich diversity of public dialog\u201d (p. 7). As illustrated, social media has exponentially changed the decision-making environment for consumers. Given the pervasiveness of the internet and the ease of sharing information, companies are motivated now more than ever to enter into this communication domain in a way that maintains credibility and promotes engagement. In turn, individuals want to do more than consume: they want to work with companies to share their knowledge and creative ideas.\n\nThe recent Marketing Science Institute ranking of 2012 \u2013 2014 research priorities states that \u201ctrust between people and their institutions and in social networks\u201d (MSI 2012, p. 5) is of great significance. Of specific concern are the methods companies can implement to build trust in ways that have favorable behavioral (i.e., marketplace) outcomes. Additional research on the role of trusted advisors and decision-making is also requested. Therefore, the present research seeks to discover how collaboration can be used for trust-building. Information about collaborative product development will then be experimentally tested in the context of online blogging- a domain where consumers have considerable influence over product and brand discussions.\n\nIn this paper, I use a mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) approach across two studies to discover the elements and consequences of collaboration most important to consumers (Study 1) and to test how changes in online communication affect trust, attitude, and purchase decisions when collaboration is present or absent (Study 2). Using adult participants with children, I test for these differential effects using a real blog designed for parents. Together, the studies demonstrate that consumers\u2019 attitudes, evaluations, and purchase decisions are influenced by a product\u2019s collaborative development. Consumer collaboration has also been identified as a key moderator useful in overcoming the negative effects of a blog\u2019s disclosure (e.g., monetary payment) and source (e.g., company-owned) on evaluations. As service-dominant (S-D) theory suggests, a product\u2019s utility can increase even when the consumer is tangentially engaged (Vargo and Lusch 2004). Informing consumers of the collaborative nature of a product\u2019s development is enough to engage consumers and significantly improve evaluations.\n\nIn a recent survey of nearly 4,000 marketers from around the world, most reported plans to significantly decrease their use of traditional marketing communications (Stelzner 2012). For example, 53% have no plans to use or will decrease the use of print ads (p. 38). A large majority (78%) have no plans to use or will decrease the use of television ads (p. 39). Alternatively, 68% indicate plans to increase the use of blogs (p. 26). This pattern is also reflected for other media channels and suggests a positive response by companies for consumers\u2019 changes in communication preferences. Consumers want information about brands and products to be delivered in a socially interactive manner. While commercial websites fail to meet this need, other online venues (e.g., blogs, forums, and social networks) easily address this issue. This shift generally results in greater C2C discourse, but new ways of integrating the consumer into value creation has presented an opportunity for better relationship management. Consumer collaboration is a powerful marketing strategy. Its benefits include increased satisfaction, higher levels of brand loyalty, and a more sustainable competitive advantage (Roser and Samson 2009). Of equal significance, as the present research illustrates, is the ability for collaboration to indirectly engage consumers in a way that also promotes positive evaluations and purchase decisions.\n\nMany companies have identical marketing measures of social media success. Unfortunately, these measures create a \u201cone-dimensional social experience\u201d (Universal McCann 2012, p. 13) for consumers. These shallow relationships occur when companies ask their customers to \u2018like\u201d them on Facebook or provide them with a coupon on a blogger\u2019s site. On the other hand, co-creative collaboration represents a very deep relationship used for building or promoting products and brands. Collaborating with every consumer is limited to those firms specializing in customized products. Most companies, though, offer mass-produced products. For these companies, the implications of collaboration information represent critical new ways to credibly (and more persuasively) market products to consumers en masse while efficiently managing resources.\n\nThe results of the first two studies extend previous research by increasing the external validity of my findings with stimuli modeled after actual consumer blogs (i.e. not scenario-based). The role of collaboration information is shown as a useful tool in moderating the negative effects of a blog\u2019s disclosure (e.g., monetary payment) and source (e.g., company-owned) on consumer evaluations. These results extend to a greater number of companies that are unlikely to utilize direct collaboration for all customers. Together, these results have implications for producers, for consumers, and for policy makers. The significantly positive effect of collaboration information also has important managerial implications. These results are promising for those marketing managers who need to comply with FTC regulations yet want to utilize collaboration to improve brand perceptions and purchase decisions without the use of covert tactics. Other policy implications stem from the current societal view of capitalism that has limited the role of companies in addressing social issues. As Porter and Kramer (2011) note,\n\n\u201c\u2026the purpose of the corporation must be redefined as creating shared value, not just profit per se. This will drive the next wave of innovation and productivity growth in the global economy. It will also reshape capitalism and its relationship to society. Perhaps most important of all, learning how to create shared value is our best chance to legitimize business again\u201d (page. 64).\nEven if consumers are not directly engaged by companies to co-create products (i.e. shared value), the simple knowledge of collaborative NPD may be enough to strengthen one of the most important factors needed for a strong and long-lasting relationship- trust."

The family-owned business are going through a generation\nchange, from the 2nd to the 3rd; there are a number of conflicts that arise for a number of\nreasons, the two most important one is that the family is growing at a faster pace than the\nbusiness, and that there is competition among the members of the thirds generation to\nmanage the largest and most appealing business. The consulting project was to assess\nthe family and the business challenges they face. The business challenges include the\nlack of formalization of roles and responsibilities, the lack of setting salaries based on\nmarket value, and the lack of predictability of the future direction of the business. The family\nchallenges include lack of corporate governance mechanisms, cousin competition, and\nunclear expectations of individuals for the businesses and the families."

But it also has been a focus of study from the factors that determine the level of FDI flows that a country receives. Two regions of interest have been Latin America and Asia. These three papers provide an update on the discussin of the determinants and effects of FDI focusin in Latin America and China.One paper talks about the employment effects of FDI, one discusses the desirable characteristics of a country that attract FDI and the last one bases FDI on the objectives of the firms that want to secure market shares, decrease costs, or have access to raw materials. \n \nSession Type:\n Paper\n \nSession Track:\n JReyes\n \nOrganizers:\n Javier A.

The first paper looks at bundling in telecom and television services and analyses the gains and loses from it. The second paper focuses on the effects that price ceilings implemented by government agencies have on Research and Development efforts by firms. The third paper looks, theoretically, at the effects that the introduction of e-textbooks have on the textbook markets, keeping in mind the strategies for selling new and used books. And, finally, the last paper focuses on the dynamics of corruption by focusing on the causes and possible differences in the dynamics of this phenomena given different initial conditions.\n \nSession Type:\n Paper\n \nSession Track:\n JReyes\n \nOrganizers:\n Javier A.

The first two papers look at financial markets data trying to assess the degree of contagion\/comovement observed across financial markets relative to the changes observed in the US markets. While the third paper focuses on the transmission into emerging economies of monetary policy changes in the US. One of the papers that focuses on financial markets also considers shocks to macroeconomic variables in the US and their effects on other countries. Finally, the last paper, attemps to explain the inflation performances in different economies by focusing on the causes that can be linked to the observed lower inflation rates in emerging economies. Some of this cuases, if not most of them, are linked to the transmission of positive\/negative shocks from the world economy into particular small open economies.\n \nSession Type:\n Paper\n \nSession Track:\n JReyes\n \nOrganizers:\n Javier A.

The simple reason being that these are two phenomena that keep increasing in magnitude and relevance to the every day life of developing and developed economies. The papers included in this session provide a wide set of perspectives on remittances and immigration. Focusing on the effects that remittances have on portfolio choices and individuals behavior. Two papers focus on the effects that remittances have on individuals' behavior in the recipient country for their participation in credit markets and the desire to pro-create (effects on fertility rates). Finally, one paper focuses on the portfolio choices and allocations of immigrants in the host countries, focusing on the degree of assimilation of portfolio\/wealth choices of immigrants.\n \nSession Type:\n Paper\n \nSession Track:\n JReyes\n \nOrganizers:\n Javier A.

Basically the literature has started to focus more on the effects that these flows have on the recipient country. Additionally, the reasons why remittances into developing countries have increased have been investigated but no definite answer has been put forward. One of the papers in this session suggests that the magnitudes and changes in the flows of remittances are related to the labor markets and business cycles of both, the recipient and the host country. The other two papers focus on the study of the effects that these type of capital flows have in the recipient economy. One links FDI, financial oppenness and Dutch Disease (real exchange rate appreciation), while the other paper focuses on the broader effects that remittances have on the overall economy when remittances are counter-cyclical or pro-cyclical. The three papers togethere provide a nice overview of the current views on the side effects that countries deal with due to the increases of remittances and FDI flows\n \nSession Type:\n Paper\n \nSession Track:\n JReyes\n \nOrganizers:\n Javier A.

The Supplemental Instruction model implemented at the University of Arkansas for face to face courses has proven to be a very successful mechanism for the support of students taking courses that are deemed difficulty courses (Stats, Math, Economics, and other science courses). The program has shown statistical improvement in subsequent cohorts in course participation, progress towards graduation and grades of the students involved in the program.\n\nThe University of Arkansas is now implementing the same Supplemental Instruction Program for Online Courses and preliminary numbers look very promising and the online platform around it is now going 360 degrees and it is providing alternative delivery modes that are being applied back to the face to face courses.\nThe University of Arkansas has identified several courses for which supplemental instruction can benefit the students. The supplemental instruction program provides additional support for students in these courses by providing them with the opportunity to work on problems and ask questions outside of the classroom. Students attend a one hour session where they can work on additional questions\/exercises, with the help of supplemental instruction leader. The SI Leader is not a faculty or an instructor but a student who took the course in a previous. The ELC manages the program, trains the student and funds the payment of a stipend for the SI Leader.\n\nThe extra time dedicated by the students to do more exercises and go over the material covered in class, is by itself a benefit of the SI sessions. But the data suggests that the ability to ask questions and interact with other students in these sessions builds up the confidence of the students.\nThe University of Arkansas has all the intentions on mirroring all the support systems provided for students on campus and wants to offer them to the online students. The Enhanced Learning Center (ELC) has partnered with the Economics Department in order to develop the SI program for online students. The current platform used to facilitate and deliver the supplemental instruction online is Bb Collaborate and it has proven to be an effective way to lead the sessions and work closely with all the students in the class. The Economics course on which the system is being implemented currently has 60 students enrolled and the idea will be to roll out Online Supplemental Instruction Sessions for Biology courses in Fall of 2013 and Math courses for Spring 2014. The objective is to serve more than 600 students by Spring 2014.\nThe University of Arkansas identified courses for which the Supplemental Instruction Model is needed but the current resources of the ELC are limited. The Bb collaborate platform allows for the expansion of the program and provides a way to scale it according to the needs of online students without taxing the ELC facilities and resources. It also provides a solution for on campus students as well. Current classroom capacity does not allow for a wider expansion of the program but if the online model is successful then it would also provide an alternative for on campus courses where students could take their SI sessions online!\n\nThese initiatives stands on the three pillars that the Global Campus put forward for the University of Arkansas.\n- Provide alternative solutions for dealing with support systems for students that applies for online courses but also provides options for face to face -on campus-courses.\n- Support programs such that the University can predicate comparable access to resources and support systems to online and face to face students. Making sure that no mode of delivery is seen as superior because of the infrastructure and support systems around it."
